# Generative AI with Large Language Models


This repo contains laboratories and assignements from the course **[Generative AI with Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms/home/info)** offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai/)

## Week 1: Introduction to LLMs and the generative AI project lifecycle

### Lab 1: Generative AI Use Case: Summarize Dialogue

> In this lab, you will do the dialogue summarization task using generative AI. You will explore how the input text affects the output of the model, and perform prompt engineering to direct it towards the task you need. By comparing zero shot, one shot, and few shot inferences, you will take the first step towards prompt engineering and see how it can enhance the generative output of Large Language Models.
